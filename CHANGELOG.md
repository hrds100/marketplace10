## 2026-04-27 — smsv2: coach model → gpt-5.4-mini

Hugo's directive after the v3 ship: switch from `gpt-4.1-mini` to
`gpt-5.4-mini`. Newer family, better stage-awareness + variation, still
mini-tier latency.

Also: improved error logging in `generateCoachSuggestion` so a wrong
model name surfaces in edge fn logs (response body included on non-2xx)
instead of silently producing zero coach cards.

Edge fn redeployed.

## 2026-04-27 — smsv2: coach prompt v3 + model upgrade (gpt-4.1-mini)

Hugo's 2026-04-26 live test still showed the coach pushing "I'll send the
breakdown — morning or afternoon tomorrow?" on 4 of 6 cards even when the
caller was just exploring or asking factual questions. v2's hard rule
"every objection ends with a soft close" forced this. v3 fixes it.

What changed:
- New stage-aware decision tree: warm-up → discovery → pitch → objection →
  close. Most lines are *talking*, not closing. The close happens once,
  at the right moment, after rapport + pitch.
- Direct-answer rule: when the caller asks a factual question (e.g.
  "where are you based?", "when is it available?"), answer it. No SMS
  deflection.
- UK English tone — explicit avoid-list of American/corporate phrases
  ("reach out", "circle back", "absolutely", "that's a great question",
  "going forward").
- Variation rule — "if your last suggestion was X, do not produce another
  version of X". Plus temperature 0.7→0.9 and presence_penalty 0.6→0.85
  in the OpenAI call.
- Bigger objection book ("what's the catch?", "sounds too good?").
- Removed v2's hard rule "every objection ends with a soft close".

Model: `gpt-4.1-nano` → `gpt-4.1-mini`. ~1.5-2x latency hit (~600-900ms
vs ~300-500ms) for noticeably better stage-awareness and variation.
Acceptable trade — agents read each line aloud, so a slight delay
doesn't break the flow. Easy to revert via the same hardcoded line if
needed.

DB updated via `supabase db push --linked` (now possible after the
2026-04-26 history cleanup). Edge fn redeployed.

## 2026-04-26 — supabase: migration history cleanup

The repo had drifted out of sync with the Supabase migration history table.
Two issues:
1. ~48 local migration files used date-only 8-digit prefixes (e.g.
   `20260314_deals_v2.sql`). The supabase CLI's `db push` filename parser
   silently skipped these and complained about "remote versions not found
   in local migrations directory".
2. The remote `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` table held 23
   phantom entries for migrations applied directly to the DB during early
   dashboard-driven development (no matching local files).

This cleanup:
- Renames all 48 date-only files to use 14-digit timestamps (with
  `000000`, `000001`, … suffixes per date for ordering). File contents
  unchanged.
- Adds 23 placeholder `*_remote_history_placeholder.sql` files (comments
  only) so the CLI can match every remote version to a local file.
- Re-records every renamed migration in `supabase_migrations` as applied.

After the cleanup, `supabase db push --linked --dry-run` reports
"**Remote database is up to date.**" Future migrations follow the
standard workflow described in `docs/runbooks/SUPABASE_MIGRATIONS.md`.

No schema changes — this PR is purely metadata + filename hygiene.

## 2026-04-26 — smsv2: past-call transcript + full-screen archive view (item F)

Hugo's 2026-04-26 ask: "Calls history page is missing recording playback
for transcripts (recording is already there). Wants the full transcript
and ability to 'go back to that screen' to see history of a call."

- New `CallTranscriptModal` component. Click the new "Transcript" button
  on any row in /smsv2/calls → modal loads `wk_live_transcripts` for
  that call_id, renders speaker-labelled lines (You / first-name).
  Modal includes an "Open full screen →" link to the new past-call route.
- New `PastCallScreen` component routed at `/smsv2/calls/:callId`. Shows
  recording (signed URL), AI summary, transcript, AI coach events
  captured live during the call. Read-only.
- New "Open" button on each /smsv2/calls row → routes to
  /smsv2/calls/:callId.
- Empty state: "No transcript captured for this call. Real-time
  transcription was added on 2026-04-25 — earlier calls don't have
  transcripts." (per the review note before this work item shipped).

This completes the live-call surface overhaul plan (items A → G).

## 2026-04-26 — smsv2: "Apply automation" mid-call button (item E)

Hugo's 2026-04-26 ask: "Mid-call actions (… change pipeline stage) need
to be reachable from the live-call screen". The agent already changes
stage via `StageSelector` on the live-call screen, but its automations
(templated SMS, task, retry-dial, tag) only fire post-call. The new
button lets the agent fire those server-side automations *now* without
ending the call.

- New `ApplyAutomationButton` component placed under `StageSelector` in
  COL 1 of LiveCallScreen.
- Reuses the existing `wk-outcome-apply` edge function (no new infra).
- Confirms before firing ("Fire this stage's automation now? The call
  stays open.").
- Surfaces success / failure via existing `pushToast`. Wraps the same
  FunctionsHttpError → real-error unwrapping pattern used by
  ActiveCallContext so the toast shows the actual server error, not the
  generic "non-2xx".
- Disabled until the call has a `callId` and the contact has a
  `pipelineColumnId`.

## 2026-04-26 — smsv2: mid-call SMS sender (item D)

New `MidCallSmsSender` component embedded at the bottom of COL 1
(LiveCallScreen). Lets the agent fire a templated SMS without leaving the
call. Reuses the same `sms-send` edge function used by /smsv2/inbox so
the message lands in `sms_messages` and follows the GHL/Twilio path —
no new infrastructure.

- Templates dropdown reads `wk_sms_templates` (admin-RLS, agent-or-admin
  read).
- `{{first_name}}` and `{{agent_first_name}}` substituted at template
  insertion.
- Free-text fallback if no templates exist.
- 160-char counter (turns amber over 160).
- Toast on success/failure (uses the existing `pushToast` from store).

## 2026-04-26 — smsv2: 4-column live-call layout (item B2)

The live-call screen is now split into 4 resizable columns. Transcript
and coach are split vertically inside col 2 with a draggable handle. The
old right-side SMS / past-calls / activity panel is replaced by the
glossary; the SMS thread is reachable via /smsv2/inbox and past calls
via /smsv2/calls. Item F adds the past-call deep-link.

- COL 1 — contact + KV (pipeline, last contact, tags, deal value, custom
  fields) + sticky notes. Mid-call SMS sender lands here in item D.
- COL 2 — transcript (smaller, default 40%) + AI coach (larger, default
  60%) split with a vertical resize handle. Coach card text scales with
  body length: <60 chars = 15px, <120 = 16px, <200 = 17px, longer = 18px,
  so the longer breakdown lines (caller refused SMS path from item A) are
  legible. Coach badge label changed: "💡 SAY" → "💡 YOU COULD SAY"
  (Hugo's note: the agent was reading "Say:" out loud).
- COL 3 — `CallScriptPane` reads the `wk_call_scripts` row flagged
  is_default. Renders a small Markdown subset (#/##/### headings, lists,
  bold/italic/code, blockquotes, hr). `{{first_name}}` and
  `{{agent_first_name}}` are substituted with the live values.
- COL 4 — `TerminologyPane`: search + click-to-expand glossary cards.
  Reads `wk_terminologies` (active rows only) with realtime subscription
  so admin edits in Settings appear without reload.

`autoSaveId` bumped from `smsv2-live-call-layout` → `…-v2` so old 3-col
widths don't bleed in. Min sizes 14/26/14/14 keep panes usable on narrow
viewports.

Coach text scaling uses tailwind utility classes only — no inline style.
Markdown is rendered without an external dep (admin-controlled content).

## 2026-04-26 — smsv2: Settings UI for call script + glossary (item G)

Hugo can now self-serve both the live-call call script and the agent
glossary from the Settings UI — no code changes needed.

- New "Default call script" card at the bottom of the **AI coach** tab.
  Loads / saves the `wk_call_scripts` row flagged `is_default = true`
  (Markdown body). The CallScriptPane on the live-call screen reads this
  same row (item B2 wires the read).
- New top-level **Glossary** tab. Lists every `wk_terminologies` entry
  with: term, optional one-line gist, expandable Markdown definition,
  reorder (▲▼), hide/show (is_active toggle), delete, and add-new.
  Realtime — agents on a live call see admin edits propagate without
  reload.
- New hooks:
  - `useDefaultCallScript` — load/save the default script row.
  - `useTerminologies` — list + add/patch/delete + realtime channel.

No frontend changes to LiveCallScreen yet — that's item B2.

## 2026-04-26 — smsv2: terminology cards + default call script (item C)

Schema scaffolding for the new live-call surface (items B2 + G).

- New table `wk_terminologies` (term, short_gist, definition_md, sort_order,
  is_active). Admin write, agent-or-admin read. Added to `supabase_realtime`
  so admin edits propagate live to the call screen. Seeded with 10 nfstay
  glossary entries (JV partnership, HMO, finder's fee, gross yield,
  occupancy, ADR, rent-to-rent, setup cost, voting, exit).
- `wk_call_scripts.is_default boolean` + partial unique index. The
  CallScriptPane reads the `is_default = true` row. Original plan called for
  a `call_script` column on `wk_ai_settings`; chose to reuse the existing
  `wk_call_scripts` table instead — it already had the right shape and zero
  callers in src. Documented in the migration header.
- Seeded a canonical NFSTAY default script (open + qualify + permission to
  pitch + JV pitch + returns + SMS-close + follow-up + objection cheatsheet).
  Hugo can edit it via the Settings UI in item G.

No frontend changes in this PR — types regen + UI ship in items G and B2.

## 2026-04-26 — smsv2: 3-column live-call layout now resizable (item B1)

Pure layout skeleton. Wrapped the existing 3-pane flex layout in a
`ResizablePanelGroup` (horizontal, `autoSaveId="smsv2-live-call-layout"`).
Each border is now draggable; widths persist per browser. Min sizes
16/30/16% keep panes usable on narrow viewports. No behaviour change, no
new components. Item B2 will split into 4 columns and add nested vertical
resize between transcript and coach.

## 2026-04-26 — smsv2: coach prompt v2 (Belfort-style + bend on SMS-refusal)

Hugo's 2026-04-26 live test surfaced that the coach was rigid: caller said
"give me the breakdown over the phone" and the coach kept echoing "I'll send
you the SMS, speak tomorrow". Coach prompt rewritten to fix that.

**What changed**
- `DEFAULT_COACH_PROMPT` in `supabase/functions/wk-voice-transcription/index.ts`
  rewritten with: a straight-line Belfort stance (assumptive, looping,
  scarcity/social-proof/urgency, never pushy), variable line length (1-3
  sentences, up to ~50 words), and an explicit CRITICAL BRANCH for when the
  caller refuses the SMS — coach now gives the spoken breakdown using the
  deal numbers, then loops back to the tomorrow follow-up.
- `max_tokens` raised 90 → 180 to fit the longer breakdown lines.
- New migration `20260426_smsv2_coach_prompt_v2.sql` UPDATEs the canonical
  singleton row in `wk_ai_settings.live_coach_system_prompt` AND changes the
  column DEFAULT so fresh installs get v2 too. The DB value and the edge
  function fallback are kept identical in the same PR.
- Existing instructional-verb post-processor regex left untouched — still
  drops lines that open with "Reintroduce…", "Tell them…", "Explain…", etc.

**Not yet shipped (next PRs in this series — work items B–G of the plan)**
- B: 4-column resizable LiveCallScreen layout (transcript + coach split,
  contact/script/terminology panes, mid-call SMS).
- C: `wk_terminologies` table + `wk_ai_settings.call_script` column.
- D: mid-call SMS sender embedded in the call screen.
- E: manual "Apply automation" button next to StageSelector.
- F: transcript modal + `PastCallScreen` route on the calls page.
- G: Settings UI — call script editor + Terminology tab.

**Living docs**
- Edge function `wk-voice-transcription` source-of-truth changed; will need
  redeploy via `scripts/deploy-function.sh wk-voice-transcription` (Hugo /
  Co-Pilot, agents do not deploy).
- Migration applied via Supabase migration runner on next deploy.

## 2026-04-25 — smsv2: real Twilio dial + mock cleanup (PRs #526–#532)

End-to-end TDD fix series so the /smsv2 surface stops being theater. Hugo
clicks Call → his phone actually rings → outcome applies to a real wk_calls
row.

**Living docs:** all wk-* edge functions deployed and ACTIVE. New function
`wk-calls-create` deployed at 2026-04-25 21:11 UTC. Updated:
`wk-voice-twiml-outgoing` (v4, also 21:11 UTC) now reads `CallId` /
`ContactId` form params and UPDATEs the pre-minted row instead of inserting
a duplicate. Full deployed list (20):

| function | role |
|----------|------|
| wk-create-agent | provision an agent profile + spend-limit row |
| wk-twilio-connect | OAuth callback for Twilio Connect |
| wk-spend-check | pre-dial spend / killswitch RPC wrapper |
| wk-spend-record | record cost after a call ends |
| wk-killswitch-check | global enable/disable flags |
| wk-outcome-apply | server automation when an outcome is picked |
| wk-leads-next | atomic "next lead" picker |
| wk-leads-distribute | bulk distribute leads to agents |
| wk-dialer-start | parallel/power-dialer originator |
| wk-dialer-answer | winner-takes-screen broadcast on first answer |
| wk-dialer-tick | poll loop for stuck queues |
| wk-ai-postcall | post-call summary + sentiment + tagging |
| wk-ai-live-coach | live transcription + coach event publisher |
| wk-voice-token | Twilio access-token mint |
| wk-voice-twiml-outgoing | TwiML for browser-initiated outbound |
| wk-voice-twiml-incoming | TwiML for PSTN→Client routing |
| wk-voice-status | call status callback receiver |
| wk-voice-recording | recording status callback receiver |
| wk-jobs-worker | scheduled background tasks |
| wk-calls-create | **NEW** mints wk_calls UUID before dialing |

### What landed

- **PR #526** — Empty store seed + atomic contact replace. The 8 mock
  contacts no longer leak into /smsv2/contacts. `useHydrateContacts` now
  calls `setContacts(real)` once instead of upserting per row on top of
  the seed.
- **PR #527** — `useCurrentAgent` hook replaces hardcoded `CURRENT_AGENT`
  (a-tom). Status bar, softphone header, live-call agent stats, and call
  greeting all show the signed-in user's real identity / spend / call
  counts.
- **PR #528** — Real Twilio dial in `startCall`. New edge function
  `wk-calls-create` mints the wk_calls row server-side; orchestrator
  invokes it, dials with `{ CallId, ContactId }` baked into TwiML params;
  `wk-voice-twiml-outgoing` now updates that row instead of inserting a
  dupe. Phase transitions only after Twilio Call accept/disconnect.
- **PR #529** — `LiveTranscriptPane` empty state. Production no longer
  shows MOCK_TRANSCRIPT / MOCK_COACH_EVENTS. Mock fallback gated behind
  `?demo=1` URL flag for internal demos.
- **PR #530** — Post-call button guard. Orange "Pick outcome" only
  renders when `call.callId` is a real UUID, so the button never appears
  for calls that didn't really happen.
- **PR #531** — Per-page mock fallbacks gated behind `?demo=1`.
  CallsPage / InboxPage / ContactDetailPage / SettingsPage stop leaking
  Sarah Jenkins / Tom Richards / fake history into production. New
  `useDemoMode()` helper reads `?demo=1` from the URL.
- **PR #532** — Inbound call wiring. `Device.on('incoming')` auto-accepts
  + notifies subscribers via `addIncomingCallListener`. ActiveCallContext
  morphs into the live-call screen for inbound PSTN calls the same way
  it does for the dialer-winner broadcast.

### Verification
- 87/87 vitest tests green (was 43 before this series; +44 across the 7
  PRs).
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean throughout.
- All edge fns ACTIVE on `asazddtvjvmckouxcmmo`.

## 2026-04-15 — Growth config backend (A/B + social proof)

Admin Growth page (/admin/marketplace/growth) now persists A/B weights and social-proof settings to a new `growth_config` Supabase table via a new `growth-config` edge function. The landing router (public/landing/index.html) and social-proof toast script (public/landing/js/social-proof.js) read from the edge function on load (2.5s timeout, localStorage cache fallback, hardcoded defaults as last resort), so admin changes finally reach real visitors within ~30s instead of dying in the admin's own browser.

## 2026-04-14 — Booking site free-user demo restored

**PR:** #468 (commit 7023a58)

### What changed
- Restored the interactive free-user demo on `/dashboard/booking-site`.
- One-line fix in `src/pages/BookingSitePage.tsx`: re-added the `if (!isAdmin && !isPaidTier(tier)) return <BookingSitePreviewPage />` branch that PR #337 (b6d057b, 2026-04-08) deleted.
- Paid users still get `BookingSiteDashboard` + magic-login to nfstay.app — unchanged.
- Admins bypass the gate and still see the full dashboard for testing.

### Regression detail
PR #337 ("convert booking-site dashboard to mockup with payment gates") intentionally unified all users onto the dashboard with payment-gated buttons, but the side effect was that free users saw the "Complete your booking site setup" empty state instead of the playable preview they had before. `BookingSitePreviewPage` stayed in the file (lines 87–370) orphaned but intact, so restoring it was a one-line edit.

### Proven by Playwright (red-then-green TDD)
`e2e/booking-site-free-demo.spec.ts`
- **RED on prod** before merge — free user landed in "Start Setup" empty state, no Brand/Content/Contact tabs. Regression confirmed.
- **GREEN locally** with the fix — preview tabs visible, dashboard tabs absent.
- Test creates a fresh free-tier user via Supabase Admin API, verifies `profiles.tier = 'free'`, injects session via localStorage. Reusable for future free-tier regression tests.

### Human verified
Hugo confirmed live on hub.nfstay.com 2026-04-14.

## 2026-04-11 — Airbnb Pricing Overhaul

**PRs:** #390, #392, #393, #394, #395, #396, #397, #398, #399, #400, #401, #402, #403

### What changed
- **Edge function `airbnb-pricing` rewritten** — switched from OpenAI Chat Completions (gpt-4o-mini, no web access) to Responses API (gpt-4o, web search enabled)
- **AI now searches the web** for real Airbnb market data (Airbtics, property articles, Expedia) to inform pricing estimates — not guessing from memory alone
- **Airbnb search URLs** generated with full filters: bedrooms, beds (1 per room), bathrooms (when available), guests (1 per bedroom), entire home only
- **3 time windows**: 7-night stays at 30, 60, 90 days out for seasonal comparison
- **"AirDNA verified"** renamed to **"Airbnb verified"** across all 6 languages
- **"Est. monthly profit"** renamed to **"Est. monthly cash flow"** — now shows full revenue, no rent subtracted
- **Temperature set to 0.2** for consistent results
- **Confidence levels**: high (real market data found), medium (area averages scaled), low (limited data)
- **Reasoning field** cites actual sources with links
- **Frontend timeouts** increased from 15-25s to 90s (web search needs time)
- **Admin deals page**: added submission date+time, description section, photo delete/replace/upload, full edit modal (description, lister type, SA approved, listing type)
- **Admin quick-list**: lister type defaults to "Deal Sourcer"

### Key finding (TDD)
OpenAI web_search cannot browse Airbnb directly (blocked). The AI uses web search to find market data from accessible sources (Airbtics, property analytics sites, Expedia) and combines it with its training data.

### Proven by Playwright tests
| Property | Nightly | Occupancy | Monthly Revenue | Confidence |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| 2-bed London | £250 | 74% | £5,550 | high |
| 5-bed Barking | £600 | 70% | £12,600 | medium |
| 3-bed Manchester | £150 | 60% | £2,700 | high |

## 2026-04-07 — Veriff KYC Identity Verification (Investment Module)

**PRs:** #323, #326, #328, #329

### What was added
- **Veriff KYC** gates payout claims on `/invest/payouts`. Users can browse and buy shares freely — KYC is only required before claiming rental income.
- New Supabase table `inv_kyc_sessions` with RLS policies (users can only see/edit their own row).
- Two new edge functions:
  - `inv-kyc-check` — checks KYC status, queries Veriff API if session is pending
  - `inv-kyc-save-session` — saves Veriff session ID after widget creates it
- New React hook `useKycStatus` and `KycVerificationModal` component.
- KYC status card on payouts page with 4 states:
  - **Loading** — skeleton shimmer
  - **Not started / Declined** — "Verify Now" button (brand green `#1E9A80`)
  - **Pending** — amber card with "Continue Verification" button
  - **Approved** — green "Identity Verified" card
- Claim flow is gated: clicking Claim opens KYC modal if not approved.
